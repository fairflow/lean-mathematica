It's rare for me to fork code but as I'm learning Lean, know and love Mathematica well, I want to see
if I can get the link working.  There are a number of steps involved so it will take a while and you 
may well find the same.

I'm forking it now in the anticipation that there will be breaking in porting from Lean 3 to Lean 4
and possibly to v14 of Mathematica; and in any case I would like to be free to mess around with the
code and share it without friction.  If things work out I may be able to contribute back to the
original project which has not been updated in a while.
